HomeAutomation
==============
Provides a very simple PYTHON interface to the LightwaveRF Home Automation suite.

Integration with the WiFi link system was based on the code available at http://blog.networkedsolutions.co.uk/?p=149  

Additional support came from www.wireshark.org allowing investigation of network traffic between official devices and the code in this application.
